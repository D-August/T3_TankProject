  sentences:
  - Before we proceed, I'd like to assess our ammo situation.
  - The HE 37mm steel capped round is a explosive ammunition designed to take town
    heady ground targets and weak constructions. He have plenty of those, so fire
    away!
  - The Phase Shield round was produces with backward engineering from stolen enemy
    tech. As it hits the ground, it produces a Stasis Magnetic Field that will stop
    even heavy enemy artillery. The shield stays up for alimited time, so use wisely.
  - The Smoke Shell pops a cloud of white phosphate smoke that messes with the enemie's
    tracking systems. It provides a perfect window for a quick escape or a deadly
    counter attasck on unexpected foes.
  - The Eletro Magnetic Pulse was a weapon build specifically to fight our enemies.
    It emmits a disrupting field that will decommission enemies for a while. It is
    specially effective against the small enemies that pop out of those turrests,
    since the pulse is stong enough to destroy them.
